# Note, the device links created by udev on the host side of the container are
# mounted when running the container otherwise they aren't visible in the container.
# See elsabot_4wd/hwsetup/99-usb-serial.rules for the links that are created for the
# various devices used.

# USB device handling
#   The host udev rules for the USB serial devices create sym links under the directory:
#     /dev/elsabot_dev_links
#   That directory is mapped to the container.  See robot.env where env variables are
#   defined that specify the symbol links for each device.  Those env vars are used by the
#   launch scripts.
# /dev/input is mapped so /dev/input/js0 is available.
# /dev/bus/usb and cgroup rule for Oakd device
# Sound devices for speech_input_server and speech_output_server projects.
